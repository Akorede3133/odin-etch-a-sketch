A webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs. We will set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
We will add a button to the top of the screen that will enable users set  the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad. 
The limit for the user input will be set to a maximum of 100.
